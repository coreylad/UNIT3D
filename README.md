## <a name="introduction"></a> 🧐 Introduction

**BAS3D Tracker** is a fork of [UNIT3D](https://github.com/HDInnovations/UNIT3D) — a modern Private Torrent Tracker software built with Laravel, Livewire and AlpineJS. It offers a feature-rich platform with excellent performance, security and scalability to create and manage a private tracker. It is MySQL Strict Mode Compliant and PHP 8.4 Ready. It uses an MVC Architecture to ensure clarity between logic and presentation.

This fork extends UNIT3D with additional features and customisations tailored for the BAS3D Tracker community.

## <a name="fork-changes"></a> 🔀 Fork Changes

The following features have been added on top of the upstream UNIT3D codebase:

### Category Filter Bar on Torrents Page
A persistent category filter bar has been added to the `/torrents` page, allowing users to quickly filter the torrent list by category without needing to open the full search filters panel.

### Site Settings: Category Filter Bar Toggle
A new option has been added to the Staff **Site Settings** admin panel to enable or disable the category filter bar globally. Admins can control whether the filter bar is visible to users from the admin interface.
